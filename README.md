# AstroIRRemote
Quick tool to control your older Nikon camera directly on your Android device, similar to how an intervalometer works. The Android device must contain an IR blaster module in order for this app to work.

# Quick start
- Download and transfer the IRBlaster.apk onto your phone/device and you are done.

**NOTE:** This app is not yet published onto the app store as I simply created this within a few hours before going out for an astrophotograhy run.

# WIP Features
- Planned to include IR blaster patterns for other camera brands within the settings.
- Add for Bulb mode and Sound alerts when your intervals are completed.
- Allow settings to be typed via the keyboard instead of bound via the +- keys.

# Interested in building the app yourself?
It is completely fair if you do not trust the source of this .apk, if you prefer to see how the insides of the app work yourself, you may import this project into your own Unity hub, then proceed to build this app onto your device yourself. The specifications used to build this apk is mentioned within the **specifications**.

# Specifications
Unity 6000.0.31f1
 - Android Build Support (OpenJDK & Android SDK & NDK Tools)
